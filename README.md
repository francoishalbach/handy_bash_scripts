# Handy Bash Scripts
Bash scripts to automate encountered tasks

## How-To: 
Check each script's individual README.md.

## List of scripts:
1. khip-scan.sh - Scans Kubernetes hosts for kernel level connections to a given remote host IP, identifying the pod, namespace, and Kubernetes host where the connection originates, as well as IP and PORT information for the origin, gateway, and destination hosts. Can be used to identify infected hosts when the only available data is the IP address of remote hosts being scanned.

2. chk_domain_ssh_up.sh - Check a list of domains or IPs to determine if they're available via ssh.
